# This data file is used by the nav plugin to build a tree for navigation.
#
# Required:
#   path - the path component of the nav item
#
# Optional:
#   sub - the list of nav items below this one
#
# Provided automatically:
#   url - full path hierachy of the nav item
#
# Note that the paths for a nav item should be those post-processing, so for
# example, an item path for `page.md` would be `page.html` by default, and if
# `permalink: pretty` is set in the config, it would be `page/`.
#
# If a nav item is a directory (e.g. `path: dir/`) and no corresponding index.md
# file exists, a synthetic one will be generated automatically.  These generated
# index files have the following extra parameters:
#
# Optional for generated index files:
#   title - a title value (defaults to the capitalized directory name)
#   description - a description value
